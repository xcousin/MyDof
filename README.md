# MyDof
simple way to show Dof taking account the diffraction blur.
In fact, I've developed this code to migrate after in magiclantern code for the canon 700D such that we can have a graphicalbased tool to indicate the DOF taking into account the diffraction aspect.
I have retreive some equation and theory in the pdf found in this directory.
Such to develop simply, my code is based on poor windows tool openbgi - we can surely make a better graphical tool with a library more adapted on windows 
but it was the original aim
