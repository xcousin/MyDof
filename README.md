# MyDof
simple way to show Dof taking into account the diffraction blur. (may be another one)
I've developed this code to migrate in magiclantern code for the canon 700D such that we have with a basic graphical tool the DOF taking into account the diffraction aspect.
I have retreive some equation and theory in the pdf found in this directory.
Such to develop with a future migration on magiclantern, my code is based on poor windows graphical tool openbgi - 
we can surely make a better graphical tool with a library more adapted on windows and code as java
